# Functions 

C is imperative & procedural

- uses functions instead of objects

A function declaration / prototype includes name, return type & paraameter list

A function definition includes the code

## 16.4.1 The Stack

Execution stack keeps track of the state of active functions

Each func call creates a stack frame containing its parameter & local var values. 

The top frame of the stack is the active frame ==> function that is currently executing. only its parameters and local variables are in scope.

When a function is called, a new stack frame is created & push on the top of the stack & space for its local var & params allocated. 

When a function returns, its stack frame is removed(popped from the top of the stack)
