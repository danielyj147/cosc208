# 16.1 Getting started programmin in C

C is purely imperative and procedural language.

- There are no classes in C.

## Syntax

Comments:

- Single line: `//`
- Multi line: `/* */`

Statements:

- Ends in `;`

Blocks:

- Uses `{}`
- Indentations not required, but good practice

Importing:

- Uses `#include` **NOT** import at the top of the program

Main function(`int main(void) { }`):

- First function to be executed
- Only one main function
- Automatically called
- All functions are defiend outside of class definitions since there is no class.
- `void` means no parameters - but can optionally take list of command line argument as a list of strings.
- type must me `int`
- returns int value, 0 by convention.

## 16.1.1. Compiling and Running C Programs

Compiler:

- Translates C source code into a **binary executable** form

    ```bash
    gcc <input_source_file> to compile
    gcc -o <output_executable_file> <input_source_file> // do designate output name
    ./a.out // to execute output file
    ```

- Compiling with more options

    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -g -o hello hello.c // more compiler warnings & extra debugging info
    ```

- Often `make` utility is used to simplify compiling

## 16.1.2 Variables and C Numeric Types

To declare a variable:

```C
type_name variable_name;
```

String literal: any sequence of char between double quotes

- 'h' - char, ASCII value of h, 104
- "h" - string literal, NOT 104
- you can use `unsigned` in front of numeric types to only use non-negative values.
- Size of types can vary depending the architecture
- you can use sizeof(int/short/long/long long) to get the size of the types(return type is %lu = unsigned long)

Arithmetic Operators

- %: mod operator. Only takes integer-type operands(int, unsigned int, short)
- Unsignment w/ update is allowed( +=, -=, *=, /= and %=)
- ++ and -- are allowed

Warning

++x and x++ are evaluated diffrently.

```c
x = 6;
y = ++x + 2;  // y is assigned 9: increment x first, then evaluate x + 2 (9)

x = 6;
y = x++ + 2;  // y is assigned 8: evaluate x + 2 first (8), then increment x
```

Best practice: Write x++ as a separate statement.
