# 16.3. Conditionals and Loops

```c
if () {

} else if () {

} else {

}
```

## 16.3.1. Boolean Values in C

- Doesn't have boolean type
- 0 is false
- Nonzero(even a negative value) is true
- relational operators available(==, !=, <, <=, > >=)
- Short-circuit Logical operators available(!, &&, ||)
  - Short-circuit: eval stops as soons as the result is known.

## 16.3.2. Loops in C

- while

    ```c
    while ( ){

    }
    ```

- do-while

    ``` c
    do {

    } while ( ); // watch out for ;
    ```

- for

    ```c
    for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

    }
    ```

- for with multiple condition

    ```c
    for (i = 0, j=0; i<10; i+=1, j+=10) {

    }

    ```

- Any while loop can be expressed as a for loop in C & vice versa.
