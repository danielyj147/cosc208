# 16.5.Arrays and Strings

## 16.5.4. Introduction to Strings and the C String Library

In C, the length of an array is fixed, but not all spaces are always used.  
C string is a char array.  
!!! So a string may not be the same legnth as its array.  

Then how can we tell its length?

- null char(`\0`) to indicate the end. With null char, `strlen()` works as expected.
- `\0` is one char.

Null-terminated strings: strings that end with null char

Use `string.h` lib for easier string manipulation.

`printf` print all the chars in the array until `\0`
